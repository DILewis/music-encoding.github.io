[mei-friend](https://mei-friend.mdw.ac.at) is a friendly, zero-install, browser-based MEI editor for music encodings, with schema-based autocompletion, GitHub integration, keyboard shortcuts, an easy to use look-up interface to the MEI Guidelines, and other goodies. The tool is intended as a ‘last mile’ editor aiming to alleviate the common task of cleaning up encodings generated via optical music recognition, or via conversion from other formats. Further details are available from the tool's [GitHub page](https://github.com/signature-Sound-Vienna/mei-friend-online/), where it is also possible to [submit bug reports, feature requests, and additions to the public repertoire](https://github.com/signature-sound-vienna/mei-friend-online/issues/new/choose) available directly through the application.

mei-friend was originally implemented as a [plugin package](https://web.archive.org/web/20220610074623/https://atom.io/packages/mei-friend) for the (since-discontinued) [Atom](https://web.archive.org/web/20221130005115/https://atom.io/) text editor, in work conducted as part of the EU H2020-funded [TROMPA project](https://trompamusic.eu) (Grant 770376).  Development of the [mei-friend Web application](https://mei-friend.mdw.ac.at) is being pursued as part of [Signature Sound Vienna](https://iwk.mdw.ac.at/signature-sound-vienna/), funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) (P 34664-G).
