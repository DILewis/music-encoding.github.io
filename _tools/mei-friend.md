[mei-friend](https://mei-friend.mdw.ac.at) is a friendly, zero-install, browser-based MEI editor for music encodings, with schema-based autocompletion, GitHub integration, keyboard shortcuts, an easy-to-use look-up interface to the MEI Guidelines, and other goodies. The tool is intended as a ‘last mile’ editor aiming to alleviate the common task of cleaning up encodings generated via optical music recognition, or via conversion from other formats. Further details are available from the tool's [GitHub page](https://mei-friend.github.io).
