[music21](https://web.mit.edu/music21/) is a simple set of tools for helping scholars and other active listeners answer questions about music quickly and simply.

music21 builds on preexisting frameworks and technologies such as Humdrum, MusicXML, and MIDI but music21 uses an object-oriented framework that makes it easier to handle complex data. At the same time music21 tries to keep its code clear and make reusing existing code simple.
