  <p style="margin-top:2em;">As a land-grant institution, UMD has a large, green, and scenic campus that can be the perfect backdrop to recharging walks and morning runs. The small town of College Park has a few dining and recreational options, with more opening up in Spring and Summer 2017, including the MilkBoy ArtHouse and “The Hotel” (including a new hotel and several new restaurants and amenities). College Park is connected via the Metro with downtown Washington DC, with its world class free museums, art venues, and a vibrant and forward looking dining scene. Once on the train a Metro ride to downtown takes approximately 25 minutes and costs $3.35 ($4.05 at peak times) with a SmarTrip card (obtainable at any station for $10 including $8 credit). The last train from downtown DC (Gallery Place / Chinatown station) is at 12:16 AM.
<p>Temperatures in College Park and the DC area in May are pleasant, with highs averaging around 24.1°C and lows around 13.6°C (Wikipedia).</p>
