[mei-friend](https://mei-friend.mdw.ac.at) is a ‘last mile’ editor for MEI music encodings intended to alleviate the common task of cleaning up encodings generated via optical music recognition, or via conversion from other formats, originally implemented as a [plugin package](https://atom.io/packages/mei-friend) for the [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor. 

The mei-friend Web Application is a reworking of the tool as a full-featured, cross-browser compatible Web application, with optimised performance and an extended set of features. The application is available online at <https://mei-friend.mdw.ac.at>, with code available [here](https://github.com/signature-sound-vienna/mei-friend-online). 

Bug reports, feature requests, and proposed additions to the built-in public repertoire listing are [gratefully accepted](https://github.com/Signature-Sound-Vienna/mei-friend-online/issues/new/choose).
