[Corpus monodicum](http://www.musikwissenschaft.uni-wuerzburg.de/forschung/corpus_monodicum/) is a long term edition project of the historically significant, sacred and secular monophonic repertories of the European Middle Ages with Latin texts. It chose MEI for digitizing their transcriptions in the preparation of both its print and digital editions. As standard notation software available on the market is not well suited for capturing transcriptions of neumatic notation, the project teamed up with the music typesetting firm Notengrafik Berlin to develop the specialized browser-based notation editor mono:di that operates directly on MEI data.
