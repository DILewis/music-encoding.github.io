One of the editors of the new edition of Haydn's complete works, reports on the possibilities that MEI offers for scholarly music editions, using partial encodings of two aria arrangements made by Joseph Haydn for the Esterházy court. The first aria, "Non per parlar d'amore", is taken from Niccolò Piccinni's opera _L'avaro_. The second example is Haydn's arrangement of the aria "Vorrei punirti, indegno" from Pasquale Anfossi's opera _La finta giardiniera_.
