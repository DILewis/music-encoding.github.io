The catalogue was created as part of the wider project ‘Delius, Modernism, and the Sound of Place’. This project 
pursued a new and comprehensive evaluation of Delius, testing the veracity of constructions of the composer as a 
nationalist and rhapsodic musical portraitist, investigating his compositional methods, and situating him within 
both different geographical contexts and the complex cultural phenomenon of modernism. Consequently, it was the 
aim of the catalogue to produce a resource that facilitated this investigation, that provided thorough and up-to-date 
information on the state of sources for a given work, its process of composition, editing, and revision, its 
performance history and its relationship to other works.
