[CRIM (Citations: The Renaissance Imitation Mass)](https://crimproject.org/) builds upon recent developments in digital music scholarship, implementing a new kind of quotable text for music, along with the analysis and commentary that illuminates its workings.The CRIM project is the product of a long partnership between Haverford College and the Centre d’Études Supérieures de la Renaissance (Tours, France), and among an international team of scholars, students, and information technologists. It grapples with allusive relationships among musical works of the sixteenth century, and with the challenges of modeling scholarly annotations of these connections in the digital domain. Our work charts much new territory, exploring a neglected genre of Renaissance music via technologies that only a few years ago were beyond our grasp. CRIM extends and enhances an topological approach to analysis and digital editions undertaken in [The Lost Voices Project](http://digitalduchemin.org/).
