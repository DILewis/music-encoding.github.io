It is our great pleasure to announce the upload of the MEC 2021 Proceedings to Humanities Commons: [https://doi.org/10.17613/fc1c-mx52](https://doi.org/10.17613/fc1c-mx52).

You find an overview of all published items, including individual contributions, bibtex metadata and abstracts, here: [https://music-encoding.org/conference/proceedings.html](https://music-encoding.org/conference/proceedings.html).

A huge collective effort and teamwork made it possible to get this volume with 24 contributions, 57 distinct authors and with a magical 222 (+2) pages ready for publication, just in time before MEC 2022. Many thanks to everyone involved!


We wish you an exciting read,
David Rizo and Stefan MÃ¼nnich
