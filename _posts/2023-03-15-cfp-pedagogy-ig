The Digital Pedagogy Interest Group of the Music Encoding Initiative invites the submission of pedagogical resources to encourage the use of music encoding. Pedagogical resources may include tutorial videos, sample lesson plans, slide decks, exercises, assignments, sample encodings that demonstrate various concepts, introduction of useful tools, and crowdsourcing projects. We invite these materials to cover a broad array of topics, including but not limited to hand-encoding, optical music recognition (OMR), metadata creation, encoding for analysis, corpus study, digital collections, digital humanities projects, and incipit creation. We encourage submissions in English and other languages.

These materials will be presented in [Humanities Commons](https://hcommons.org/deposits/?tag=mei-pedagogy-praxis) and available as open scholarship. You can find examples of recent contributions on the [Pedagogy & Praxis Resources page](https://music-encoding.org/resources/pedagogy.html).

To submit your materials, [please fill out this form](https://forms.gle/CujWRBMmyciE5M7FA) by May 15th, 2023 for review. Complete materials only, no abstracts please.

If you have any questions, please reach out to the Pedagogy IG administrative co-chairs: Jessica Grimmer (jessica.grimmer at umd.edu) and Anna Kijas (anna.kijas at tufts.edu).
