The next Music Encoding Conference will be held jointly with the TEI Conference on Monday 4th - Friday 8th September, 2023, at Universität Paderborn in Paderborn, Germany. The Call for Proposals is now open and can be viewed on [this webpage](https://teimec2023.uni-paderborn.de/cfp.html).

The conference theme invites us to think about the need to encode different cultural realms — not only written musical and literary cultures, but also oral cultures, the cultures of underrepresented communities, and even cultural practices beyond language and music, such as dance, theater, and film. In coming together to identify and discuss the commonalities and differences between our two coding communities, we aim to discover new methods and new approaches to encoding culture in all its forms.
