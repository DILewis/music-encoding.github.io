I'm pleased to announce that registration for the Music Encoding Conference '22 is now open via the conference ConfTool page:

[https://www.conftool.net/music-encoding2022/index.php?page=participate](https://www.conftool.net/music-encoding2022/index.php?page=participate)

Please make use of the reduced-fee early registration rates (up to March 20, 2022) if possible. Your early registration will help us enormously with planning this complex hybrid conference!

The conference webpage has been updated with a wealth of information about MEC '22. Please have a look:
