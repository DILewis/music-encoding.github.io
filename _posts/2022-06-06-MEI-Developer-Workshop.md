We’re happy to announce that Enote in Berlin (Germany) will host the next MEI Developer Meeting (local organization: Klaus Rettinghaus). 

The meeting is scheduled for October 1–3, 2022, and, at least at this point, we assume that it can be held as an in-person event.

The main objective of this working meeting is to discuss and work on various topics and ideas related to the technical development of MEI.

For more information about the venue, accomodations, and a link to the registration form, please see the announcements on Slack or MEI-L.

Looking forward to meeting you in Berlin,
Klaus Rettinghaus, Benjamin W. Bohl & Stefan Münnich
