    <h1>Venue information</h1>
    <p>The conference will take place at City St George's, University of 
        London, Northampton Square, EC1V 0HB. </p>
    <p>We will be using various rooms in several buildings of the campus, 
        but all of them connect, so we recommend you always use the main 
        entrance on the square itself. The conference registration will 
        be in the atrium.</p>
    <p>Teas and coffees will be provided on Tuesday-Friday, and vegetarian
        and vegan sandwich lunch on Wednesday and Thursday. For other days, 
        there is a canteen on the first floor, but also many nearby lunch 
        options including a large variety of places in Exmouth Market.
    </p>
    <h2>Finding your rooms</h2>
    <p>Helpers and organisers will be on hand to get you to your rooms, and 
        there is also a dedicated navigation app called <a href="
https://studenthub.citystgeorges.ac.uk/student-support-services/it-services/citynav">CityNav</a>.
       Below is a list of conference rooms and how to get there from the big
       staircases in the main entrance (near the big 'CITY' sign).

    <h3>Monday</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>B104 & B103</summary>
        <p>Go one flight up the main staircase in the entrance area to the first floor.
            Turn right and head down the corridor. The Rooms B103 and B104 are on 
            your right.
        </p>
    </details>
    <h3>Tuesday</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>C309</summary>
        <p>Go one flight up the main staircase in the entrance area to the first floor.
            Turn left and head down the corridor, following the line labelled 
            'Tait building'. When you reach a wide area with a chess set, head up 
            the stairs that are on your right. You need to go up two more floors.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>ELG04</summary>
        <p>Go one flight down from the entrance area to the lower floor.
            The room is well-signed and on through the doors on your left.
        </p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>B200</summary>
        <p>Go two flights up the main staircase. B200 is on the landing
            behind big double doors.
