            <p>MEC 2025 will be held at City St George's, 
                University of London (formerly City University, 
                London) at Northampton Square, EC1V 0HB, in
                 an old area of London called Clerkenwell.</p>

        <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>The venue is a moderate walk from Farringdon station, Barbican station or The Angel, Islington, and is well connected by bus.</p>

            <h3>By plane</h3>
            <p>From <strong>Heathrow Airport</strong>, some Elizabeth Line trains will take you directly to Farringdon. If using the Heathrow Express or your Elizabeth Line train is one that terminates at Paddington, you can change at Paddington station and finish the journey on the Elizabeth Line.</p>
        
            <p>From <strong>Gatwick Airport</strong>, City Thameslink trains will take you straight to Farringdon, taking about 40 minutes.</p>
        
            <p>From <strong>City Airport</strong>, you will already be on the London Underground network, so there are multiple options. Probably the simplest is to take a DLR train to Bank station and then change onto the Northern Line (Northbound), getting off at Angel.</p>
        
            <p>From <strong>Stansted Airport</strong>, Stansted Express trains run to Liverpool Street station, from which there are several London Underground options (such as the Circle or Elizabeth Lines to Farringdon) or buses (such as the 205). The Train itself takes about 50 minutes.</p>
        
            <h3>Eurostar</h3>
        
            <p>Trains from the continent arrive in St Pancras International, which is a long, but pleasant walk away from the conference venue. Alternatively, the Northern Line (Southbound) will take 2 minutes to get to Angel station.</p>

            <p>Contactless credit and debit cards, along with smartphone payment systems, generally run well on the underground, buses and London-only trains (including trains from Gatwick). No registration is necessary. You should tap on the reader at the gates when you enter and exit the tube. If you are travelling by bus, you just need to tap on entry. </p>
            <p>Those who want to take the faster Heathrow Express to and from the airport will need to buy a ticket, which are cheaper to buy well in advance.</p>
            <p>Those who do not have a suitable payment method can buy an Oyster Card at most stations and newsagents. These are pre-pay contactless cards and work in a similar way.</p>

            <p>The UK have introduced an <strong>electronic travel authorisation (ETA)</strong> system for most countries whose citizens until recently have not required a visa for visiting. Those coming from the US, Canada and the EU will all need to preregister and pay a Â£10 fee. Each ETA lasts 2 years. For more information and to apply, visit the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-an-electronic-travel-authorisation-eta">government's website</a> (UK government sites all have the .gov.uk domain name - treat information on other domains with suspicion).</p>

            <p>Please contact the organisers if you need an invitation letter or would like some help working out what you need.</p>

            <p>London is currently quite an expensive place to be and 
                Clerkenwell, being quite an old area has few big hotels nearby.
                There's no hard-and-fast rule for finding good deals in London, 
                so looking at sites such as booking.com, chains (such as 
                Travelodge, Ibis) and house-share sites (such as AirBnB) is 
                recommended.</p>
            <p>For those for whom it is appropriate, we have heard good things
                about a relatively close Christian guest house, the <a 
                href="https://www.thehighburycentre.org/">The Highbury Centre</a>
                More broadly, cheaper accommodation may be found further afield 
                for attendees who don't mind travelling by public transport. In
                particular, the Elizabeth Line and Thameslink regional train 
                service go quite quickly to commuter towns that may have less 
                expensive hotels (this depends on how long you can put up with 
                being on a train, but, for example, Romford and Croyden are
                both commutable and pretty far out).
