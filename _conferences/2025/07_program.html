				<summary>LinkedMusic Workshop</summary>
				<p>This workshop is an open workshop. The goal of the LinkedMusic Partnership is to link music databases through metadata schemas: structures for organizing information stored in a database. This will go a long way towards bringing online music search to the same level of sophistication currently possible for text-based resources, allowing us to answer fundamental questions about music and how it interacts with human creativity, society, culture, and history.

            	<summary>Navigating and Processing MEI Data with XPath and XSLT</summary>
            	<p>Presenter(s): Martha E. Thomae<sup>1</sup>, Perry Roland<sup>2</sup>, Johannes Kepper<sup>3</sup></p>
            	<p>This workshop is intended for individuals with some knowledge of MEI who want to learn how to work with XML markup for research and analysis. It provides a hands-on introduction to XPath, a powerful query language for XML documents, and XSLT, a language for transforming XML data. By engaging with XSLT's functional programming approach, participants will explore ways to articulate and investigate research questions rooted in an XML-based document model.
            		The emphasis of our workshop is extracting data (or metadata) from MEI documents for analysis. Markup in documents supplies structures and contexts that are especially useful for processing data beyond what we can do with "plain text." Most of the workshop will focus on learning basic XPath navigation and some calculation functions. After this, we will show how XPath is applied in XSLT templates to address specific elements that hold data of interest for visualization (e.g., notes) and exemplify some fundamental transformations. We will produce simple structured documents for storing, sharing, and visualising data during the workshop: HTML lists (and tables) and CSV files.
            		We look forward to processing some participant-supplied MEI before, during, and after the workshop. We will carefully document the XSLT we supply during the workshop to help participants revise and adapt the code to their projects.</p>

        		<summary>Annotating Music Scores: Representing and interacting with annotations with MEI and Verovio</summary>
        		<p>Presenter(s): Kevin R. Page<sup>1</sup>, Laurent Pugin<sup>2</sup>, David M Weigl<sup>3</sup>, David Lewis<sup>1</sup></p>
        		<p>This half-day workshop will address annotations of musical scores, considering their role and
        			structure, and strategies for representing, encoding and visualising them. The workshop will
        			combine presentations, discussion and hands-on activities with new versions of Verovio and
        			mei-friend.
        			Annotation is an activity common across many walks of life and, for music, it unites scholars,
        			musicians, teachers and composers. The practice is extremely varied, both in the forms it
        			takes and the purposes it serves, and it is used for both physical and digital material. Digital
        			annotations refer to highlights, circles, references, links or other selections made on digital
        			documents or media. User-generated annotations are increasingly seen as a key mechanism
        			for the use and reuse of digital materials across a wide range of applications, while also
        			enhancing the findability and accessibility of that media through its annotations.
        			While the importance of annotations in music notation is generally acknowledged, there is
        			less of a consensus on how best to integrate them into interoperable software applications.
        			Annotations for music can encompass the association of textual observations with regions of
        			a work; cross-reference between musical passages or from a musical passage to some other,
        			non-musical, material; or they might include categorical or structured music-analytical
        			annotations, such as metrical or harmonic labels; most commonly, perhaps, they are used by
        			musicians and teachers for sharing or remembering aspects of musical interpretation.
        			Approaches taken in the digital domain include graphical, drawn overlays on top of an
        			engraved score (which is popular in software for musicians and teachers), the use of URLs to
        			specify score regions to be extracted and drawn by a web service (EMA, used by the CRIM
        			project1), Web Annotations (a Linked Data standard used by the MELD framework2) and the
        			MEI &lt;annot&gt; element itself. Given this diversity, it is essential to align implementation to
        				specific needs and use cases rather than assuming a universal solution.
        				This workshop consolidates a review of existing digital score annotation implementations,
        				presenting new recommendations for enhanced annotation practice in MEI, and with
        				hands-on experiments for implementing these recommendations in Verovio and mei-friend.</p>

            	<summary>Making sense of music: de- and encoding music information</summary>
            	<p>Keynote speaker: Anja Volk</p>
            	<p>In Matt Haigs popular sci-fi novel “How to stop time”, Tom Hazard, currently looking like a 41-year-old, has been playing music for four centuries, being 439 years old due to a rare condition of aging much slower than ordinary people. In attempting to make sense of his 400-years-old existence to find a path forward, he also seeks to make sense of the role of music in his long life.</p>
            	<p>Becoming a music researcher is often motivated by making sense of music one way or another, though we usually have much less than 400 years of personal experience we can draw upon. With the digital encodings we have at hand now, we process music information that spans way more than 400 years, as demonstrated at this year’s MEC conference, with papers addressing Gregorian tradition, polyphonic lute music, Schubert, Stravinsky, post-tonal music, Klezmer, or electroacoustic and film music. The diversity of research topics addressed, such as the study of melody, musical form, polyphony, repeated structures, performances or visualizations, demonstrate different aspects of our musical scholarship related to de- and encoding of music information. In attempting to make sense of music together, how do we connect these different perspectives on music?</p>
            	<p>To open a reflection on this question during the conference, I will discuss in my talk examples from 25 years of research at Utrecht University on de- and encoding of music information, connecting musicological inquiries on musical structures with applications of these structures in different interaction contexts. In our case, finding connections between musical structures and interactions is crucial for demonstrating why music research matters within the academic and societal context in which we work. It also became important in our education of students at the intersection of computer science and music, for making sense of music together in the classroom, which brings me back to Tom Hazard.</p>
            	<p>Tom’s wish to live an ordinary life after 400 years, leads to a decision to become a schoolteacher in contemporary London. When interacting with rather disinterested teenagers, he offers a (sometimes comical) stage for making sense of his long life while educating the next generation. I can relate to this experience. Making sense of music together with students in the classroom has provided a (sometimes comical) learning experience for me that also sharpens my mind on finding connections between different aspects of musical inquiries, and on staying connected to why music matters to us.  I will discuss examples from teaching computer science students about the de- and encoding of music information, and from my colleague Peter van Kranenburg’s experience of teaching machine learning to musicology students. In preparing a new inter-faculty course for both student groups, we now seek to find connections for both groups to make sense of music together. This community has given us inspirations for teaching in the past, and I welcome ideas and reflections on making sense of music in the classroom by engaging different aspects of our musical inquiry during MEC2025.</p>

    		<strong>5:15-6:15PM Keynote</strong> (Chair: David Lewis (Goldsmiths, University of London | University of Oxford))
    		<details>
    			<summary>A quarter-century of music encoding.</summary>
    			<p>Presenter(s): Tim Crawford </p>
    			<p>One way or another, I have been involved with ‘music encoding’ for well over 25 years now. It started in 1987 with my first Macintosh computer, on which I played with a program called Hypercard, which you could get to play tunes rather crudely; I was soon exploring how to make it play from lute tablature, for which I needed my own encoding format. Soon after, I met the late Donald Byrd, then working on his music-notation editor, Nightingale, a Macintosh program which never achieved the success it deserved. Don’s colleague, John Gibson, helped me to hack together, using bits of code from Nightingale, my own Tablature Processor for Mac, which soon died owing to my failure to keep up with successive OS upgrades. But I was able to use it in earnest in an exacting project, providing modern tablature for a pair of volumes of my own scholarly edition of the lute music of Silvius Leopold Weiss (1687-1750).</p>
    				<p>Don and I worked on several projects together, including Online Music Recognition and Search (OMRAS), which received joint US/UK funding for three years. It was at the suggestion of our US funders, the NSF Digital Libraries Initiative, that we hold an international workshop, which in fact became the first ISMIR conference (Plymouth, Massachusetts, 2000). Already, with Don and John Gibson, I had contributed a chapter to Beyond MIDI (1999) about the Nightingale Notelist, an ASCII-based encoding format for music which captured many of the features of Nightingale itself. But all was swept aside by the rapid domination of formats based on XML, which itself had only existed for a decade or so at that point. At the second ISMIR (Bloomington, Indiana, 2001), I was witness in a pub to what can best be described as a ‘lively discussion’ between Michael Good, whose MusicXML had just got going, and Perry Roland, about the relative merits of elements and attributes for certain features of music which I don’t need to go into here.</p>
    				<p>Since the last time I was honoured to give an MEC keynote (at Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2014), Perry’s baby, MEI (amusingly, known to my email client as ‘Mei’), has grown up considerably. I shall try to summarise briefly some of the achievements of those here at MEC, and some who can’t be present, to bring this about. There will be many omissions, for which I apologise in advance, as I don’t pretend to keep up to date in every facet of MEI’s development, and there may well be things happening which none of us know about - such is the nature of Open Source. But I hope it will be a non-technical and personal survey showing something of MEI’s current range and scope that was just a dream back in 2014, and certainly undreamt of in 1999.</p>
