    <p>
        We recognize that authors of academic works use a variety of tools in the research on which they report, and to prepare the report itself, from simple ones to very sophisticated ones. Community opinion on the appropriateness of such tools may be varied and evolving; AI powered language tools have in particular led to significant debate. We note that tools may generate useful and helpful results, but also errors or misleading results; therefore, knowing which tools were used is relevant to evaluating and interpreting academic works. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the view of this, we
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            require authors to report in their work any significant use of sophisticated tools, such as instruments and software; we now include in particular text-to-text generative AI among those that should be reported consistent with subject standards for methodology.
        </li>
        <li>
            remind all colleagues that by signing their name as an author of a contribution, they each individually take full responsibility for all its contents, irrespective of how the contents were generated. If generative AI language tools generate inappropriate language, plagiarized content, errors, mistakes, incorrect references, or misleading content, and that output is included in academic works, it is the responsibility of the author(s).
        </li>
        <li>
            generative AI language tools should not be listed as an author; instead authors should refer to (1).
        </li>
    </ol>
