# Music Encoding Initiative Community Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of the Music Encoding Initiative community is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in the Music Encoding Initiative community to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## **2. Open-Source Community Citizenship**

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open-source community citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to fully contribute, we want to know.

## **3. Expected Behavior**

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## **4. Unacceptable Behavior**

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community, these include, but are not limited to:

* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.

* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.

* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.

* Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information against their will or with malicious intent ("doxing").

* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.

* Inappropriate photography or recording.

* Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.

* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.

* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).

* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## **5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior**

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## **6. Reporting Guidelines**

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify any individual Board member, email the MEI Board at mei-board at lists.uni-paderborn.de, or [submit an anonymous report](https://forms.gle/jh9hRxGxooffWszW9) as soon as possible with as much information as you have, including:

* Identifying information (name) of the individual doing the harassing

* The behavior that was in violation of the Code of Conduct

* The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made)

* The circumstances surrounding the incident

* Other people involved in the incident

Anonymous reporting is possible, but this Code of Conduct encourages you to provide your contact details with any report whenever possible. We will keep the name and identity of any reports confidential unless explicitly discussed with the person reporting. Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## **7. Addressing Grievances**

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, [complete this form](https://forms.gle/jh9hRxGxooffWszW9) with a concise description of your grievance. 

## **8. Scope**

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This Code of Conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
