The constitutional meeting of the *MEI Board* after the *2017 MEI Board Elections* took place on 15 January 2018 at 7 pm UTC via Elluminate. In order to establish the Board's capacity to act the roles of the Administrative Chair and the two Technical Co-chairs had to be filled. Johannes Kepper volunteered as Administrative Chair and was reappointed with six approvals and one abstention out of seven votes. Andrew Hankinson and Perry Roland were appointed Technical Co-Chairs with broad consent.

## Roles

After processing the above formalities a warm round of welcome went to all (re-)elected members of the MEI Board, and especially to Norbert Dubowy as new member of the MEI Board. Norbert volunteered to help with the Documentation of MEI. It was broad consesnus that he should closely work together with Kristina Richts (responsible for the website) and both will interface with the technical issues through the Technical Co-Chairs and Laurent Pugin. Benjamin W. Bohl will remain responsible for taking minutes in the Board Meetings.  

## MEI Metadata Workshop at Mainz

The MEI Metadata Workshop at the Mainz Academy was a great success and proved very fruitful for both the attendees and MEI. Follow-up events are very desirable.
