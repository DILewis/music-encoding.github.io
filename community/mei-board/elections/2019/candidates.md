# 2019 Board Election Candidates

Candidates for the MEI Elections are invited to send along a brief CV and Candidate Statement. These are provided below, ordered alphabetically by surname.

## Elsa De Luca

#### CV

I am an early music palaeographer with a broad interest in musical manuscripts (notation, liturgy, and materiality). I hold a PhD in Historical Musicology (Università del Salento, 2011) and a Piano Diploma (2002). I currently hold the position of Postdoctoral Research Fellow at CESEM (NOVA University of Lisbon), where I am pursuing research into early Iberian notation. As part of this role, I am Development Coordinator of the *Portuguese Early Music Database* and I am co-director of the new book series MUSAM, published by Brepols. This appointment follows two previous postdoctoral fellowships at CESEM (05/2011-04/2013) and at the University of Bristol (05/2013-08/2016). 

As a palaeographer of Old Hispanic chant, I have contributed significant knowledge to the field, through my breakthrough discoveries on cryptography and notation. These discoveries have advanced scholarship and led to publications in major journals (*Early Music History* and *Journal of Medieval Iberian Studies*). In the digital humanities my most important contribution has been the co-founding of *Cantus Index*, a research tool that integrates 11 international chant databases and permits searches for the chants for the mass and office by text or melody. I have collaborated in many research projects in Italy, France, Portugal, the UK and Canada.

#### Statement

I am honoured to be nominated as a candidate in the elections for the MEI Board. I was first introduced to MEI by my colleagues in the SIMSSA/CANTUS ULTIMUS projects at McGill University and felt immediately enthusiastic about its goals and ambitions. I presented a paper on Old Hispanic notation at the MEI Conference in Montreal (2016) and I have actively contributed to the development of the MEI Neume Module (Version 4.0). I would very much welcome the opportunity to contribute further to the vision and mission of MEI with my expertise as a music palaeographer with considerable experience with musical databases (https://sites.google.com/fcsh.unl.pt/elsadeluca/online-publications?authuser=0). The study of different styles of early neumatic notations has equipped me with a deep understanding of the methodological challenge of converting music into a machine-readable format that simultaneously allows musical analysis and accurate information retrieval. I have, therefore, gained the necessary skills and knowledge to contribute successfully to the development of MEI and, more specifically, to revitalize the discussion on the MEI Neume Module and its interoperability across the various styles of early notations. In addition, I look forward to promoting new MEI-related activities (seminars, sessions at conferences, workshops, etc.).


## Ichiro Fujinaga

#### CV

Ichiro Fujinaga is an Associate Professor at the Schulich School of Music at McGill University.  He has degrees in Mathematics (B.Sc, University of Alberta), Music/Percussion (B.Mus, University of Alberta), Music Theory (MA, McGill University), and Music Technology (PhD, McGill University). In 2003-4, he was the Acting Director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT). In 2016–17, he was the Associate Dean (Research), Department of Music Research. Before returning to McGill in 2002, he was a faculty member of the Computer Music Department at the Peabody Conservatory of Music of the Johns Hopkins University.

He is the Principal Investigator of the Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis (SIMSSA) project. Along with Andrew Hankinson, we were co-chairs of the Music Encoding Conference in Montreal (2016).

Research interests include optical music recognition, music theory, machine learning, music perception, digital signal processing, genetic algorithms, and music information acquisition, preservation, and retrieval.

#### Statement

I am pleased to be nominated to continue serving on the MEI Board. As I said in my opening of our paper (with Andrew Hankinson and Perry Roland) in 2011 entitled “MEI as a Document Encoding Framework” at the ISMIR conference in Miami: “I’m in love with MEI!” She is like my niece and I would like to continue supporting, promoting, and encouraging her as she grows up. I was first introduced to MEI in Baltimore at the ISMIR conference in 2003 and became an instant fan.

I am particularly interested in neume notations and I participated in the development of the new version (4.0) of the MEI Neume Module. I also maintain the MEI Neumes Interest Group mailing list.

## Klaus Rettinghaus

#### CV

I have degrees in physics (diploma) and musicology (PhD). I’ve been singing for most of my life, and much of that time has been spent in choirs, several times I sung and acted on stage, and even conducted here and there. Sometimes I find coding quite relaxing.

Since 2011 I’m working at the Leipzig Bach Archive and there I’m involved in the development of Bach digital. Therefore I fell in love with metadata and authority control. I’m member of the MEI Technical team and the Metadata and Cataloging Interest Group.

#### Statement

I feel honoured to have been nominated as member of the MEI Board. It is a privilege to serve the community and a pleasure to work with so many great people.

For more than five years now I am strongly interested in MEI. I introduced it in Leipzig and try to encourage and help others using it. I am particularly interested in music engraving in combination with MEI. So I invented MEILER (https://github.com/rettinghaus/MEILER) and take part in the development of Verovio (http://www.verovio.org/).

Being a board member, I hope to be able to put even more love and time into MEI.

## Perry Roland

#### CV

I have many years of experience with MEI, having dabbled in it at the end of the last century.  Before, during, and after that I was (and will be) a teacher (mostly of music, but other things as well) and a student (again, mostly music, but other things too).
 
At various times, I have been a performer (tuba, piano, recorder, crumhorn, and sackbut, if you must know), academic (2 Master’s degrees, no Ph D), librarian (government documents and metadata), and technologist (“scripter” – I dare not say “programmer”), mostly of the “pseudo” variety of each, and may be again in the future.
 
I like to think that my wide range of experience gives me the ability to look at problems and their solutions from multiple vantage points, but I will let others be the judge of that.

#### Statement

I am happy to stand for election for the MEI Board.  I’m very grateful to the Community for its continuing support of MEI.  I have been fortunate to work alongside so many intelligent and thoughtful people.  MEI has reached a level of success that some projects, regardless of their worthiness, never see.  However, that doesn’t mean the work on MEI is finished.
 
Having ironed out many of the technical issues that come with the comprehensive scope of MEI (but certainly not all), much work remains to be done, including more (and better) documentation and outreach, as well as an improved plan for financial sustainability.  If I am elected, I will continue to work for a better MEI.
