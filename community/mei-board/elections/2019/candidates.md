Candidates for the MEI Elections are invited to send along a brief CV and Candidate Statement. These are provided below, ordered alphabetically by surname.

## Ichiro Fujinaga

#### CV

Ichiro Fujinaga is an Associate Professor at the Schulich School of Music at McGill University.  He has degrees in Mathematics (B.Sc, University of Alberta), Music/Percussion (B.Mus, University of Alberta), Music Theory (MA, McGill University), and Music Technology (PhD, McGill University). In 2003-4, he was the Acting Director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT). In 2016–17, he was the Associate Dean (Research), Department of Music Research. Before returning to McGill in 2002, he was a faculty member of the Computer Music Department at the Peabody Conservatory of Music of the Johns Hopkins University.

He is the Principal Investigator of the Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis (SIMSSA) project. Along with Andrew Hankinson, we were co-chairs of the Music Encoding Conference in Montreal (2016).

Research interests include optical music recognition, music theory, machine learning, music perception, digital signal processing, genetic algorithms, and music information acquisition, preservation, and retrieval.

#### Statement

I am pleased to be nominated to continue serving on the MEI Board. As I said in my opening of our paper (with Andrew Hankinson and Perry Roland) in 2011 entitled “MEI as a Document Encoding Framework” at the ISMIR conference in Miami: “I’m in love with MEI!” She is like my niece and I would like to continue supporting, promoting, and encouraging her as she grows up. I was first introduced to MEI in Baltimore at the ISMIR conference in 2003 and became an instant fan.

I am particularly interested in neume notations and I participated in the development of the new version (4.0) of the MEI Neume Module. I also maintain the MEI Neumes Interest Group mailing list.

## Perry Roland

#### CV

I have many years of experience with MEI, having dabbled in it at the end of the last century.  Before, during, and after that I was (and will be) a teacher (mostly of music, but other things as well) and a student (again, mostly music, but other things too).
 
At various times, I have been a performer (tuba, piano, recorder, crumhorn, and sackbut, if you must know), academic (2 Master’s degrees, no Ph D), librarian (government documents and metadata), and technologist (“scripter” – I dare not say “programmer”), mostly of the “pseudo” variety of each, and may be again in the future.
 
I like to think that my wide range of experience gives me the ability to look at problems and their solutions from multiple vantage points, but I will let others be the judge of that.

#### Statement

I am happy to stand for election for the MEI Board.  I’m very grateful to the Community for its continuing support of MEI.  I have been fortunate to work alongside so many intelligent and thoughtful people.  MEI has reached a level of success that some projects, regardless of their worthiness, never see.  However, that doesn’t mean the work on MEI is finished.
 
Having ironed out many of the technical issues that come with the comprehensive scope of MEI (but certainly not all), much work remains to be done, including more (and better) documentation and outreach, as well as an improved plan for financial sustainability.  If I am elected, I will continue to work for a better MEI.
