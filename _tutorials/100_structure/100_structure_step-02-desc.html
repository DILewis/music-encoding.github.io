    <p id="tutorialGoal">In this step you will learn how to apply attributes to elements and the use of namespaces.</p>
    <p>As mentioned in the previous step, the name of the root element of an XML document is basically an arbitrary name that has no meaning in itself. To make clear in which context an element is defined and to avoid element name conflicts, XML makes use of so called namespaces. Namespaces can be declared by adding a <code>@xmlns</code> attribute to the root element.</p>
    <p>Attributes of an element are used to define properties of a particular object and are represented as key-value pairs, taking the form key=”value”. They are added inside of the opening tag of an element and separated by single space, like e.g. <code>&lt;element attributeKey1="attributeValue1" attributeKey2="attributeValue2"&gt;&lt;/element&gt;</code> (In prose, attribute and element names are distinguished by an additional <code>“@”</code> character on the attribute name, e.g., <code>@xmlns</code>, even though this symbol does not appear in the XML encoding.)</p>
    <p>The MEI namespace is: <code>http://www.music-encoding.org/ns/mei</code></p>
