    <p id="tutorialGoal">In this step, you get accustomed with some very basic XML backgrounds and you will write your first MEI tag.</p>
    <p>MEI uses XML to represent music notation. XML is a hierarchical encoding system in which elements are the core objects. They are represented using so called “tags”. Most of the time these tags consist of a opening tag, that is a name enclosed in angle brackets like e.g. <code>&lt;element&gt;</code>, and its corresponding closing tag <code>&lt;/element&gt;</code>. If there is no content between these two tags (like text or other elements) the element can be shortened to a so called self-closing tag of the form <code>&lt;element /&gt;</code>. In any case, every opened tag must be closed later on.</p>
    <p>You can think of an XML document like a tree that branches from one (outer) root element to nested (inner) child elements. The root element is the parent of all other elements. In MEI documents this root element is called – for obvious reasons – <code>&lt;mei&gt;</code>, but it could have been any arbitrary name.</p>
