    <p id="tutorialGoal">You should be prepared now to encode the final two measures of the example with their note values.</p>

    <p>Ignore the additional elements, such as dynamics, slurs and accents at this point as they will be adressed in the next steps separately.</p>

    <p>The pause is encoded with a <code>&lt;rest&gt;</code> element having a <code>@dur</code> attribute analogue to the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element.</p>

    <p id="tutorialTask">Please encode the next measure (<code>n=2</code>) in the editor below. Add a staff and layer element which contains 4 child elements: a quarter <code>&lt;note&gt;</code>, a <code>&lt;beam&gt;</code> with to eighth <code>&lt;note&gt;</code>'s and a dotted quarter <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> with an eighth <code>&lt;note&gt;</code>.</p>
