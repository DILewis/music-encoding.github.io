    <p id="tutorialGoal">It's time to combine what you've learned in last two steps: In this step you will encode at once the next measure and the second note of the example.</p>

    <p id="tutorialTask">In the editor below, add another <code>&lt;measure&gt;</code> element (<code>n="1"</code>) with staff and layer next to the existing pickup measure. Add the second note of the example (a quarter note e4) to this new measure. Don’t worry about the measure being too short in given time signature – you’ll fill it in in the next steps.</p>
