    Step five: combining what you've learned in the last two steps, encoding at once the next measure and the second note of the example.</p>

    <p id="tutorialTask">In the editor below, add another <code>&lt;measure&gt;</code> element (<code>n="1"</code>) with staff and layer next to the existing pickup measure.
    Add the second note of the example (a quarter note e4) to this new measure. Don’t worry about the measure being too short in given time signature – you’ll fill it in in the next steps.</p>
