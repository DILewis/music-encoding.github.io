    <p id="tutorialGoal">Welcome! To <i>encode</i> a single <u>note</u>, you'll need a <code>&lt;note/&gt;</code> element and the three
        attributes <code>@pname</code> (name of the pitch), <code>@oct</code> (octave) and <code>@dur</code> (duration).</p>

    <p id="tutorialTask">So try to enter the following encoding: <code>&lt;note pname="c" oct="4" dur="4"/&gt;</code>.</p>

    <h1>Attention: This is also a tutorial on how to write tutorials now. </h1>

    <p>Tutorials consist at least of two main files:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>a Markdown file (<code>.md</code>) that defines metadata (like a tutorial name and a corresponding JSON file) in the Jekyll front matter</li>

        <li>and a JSON file (<code>.json</code>) in which all the tutorial steps are defined by the following options for each step:</li>

        <ul>
            <li><code>label</code> (string): the name for this step. If not specified, a default label will be created (Step 1, Step 2 etc.)</li>

            <li><code>editorLines</code> (integer): a specific height for the editor with integers (no strings please). If not
                specified, a default of 5 will be assumed</li>

            <li><code>descFile</code> (string): the name or path to a description file for this step</li>

            <li><code>prefillFile</code> (string): the name or path to a prefill file for this step</li>

            <li><code>xmlFile</code> (string): the name or path to a mei file for this step</li>

            <li><code>xpaths</code> (array): a set of xpath rules to be validated in this step, each one described by:</li>

            <ul>
                <li><code>rule</code> (xpath string): the actual xpath expression</li>

                <li><code>renderanyway</code> (boolean): a flag that, if set to true, tries to render the content, no matter if validation of the rule succeeds</li>

                <li><code>hint</code> (string): a hint message that will be displayed to the user as long validation does not succeed</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>As you can see above, each tutorial step has its own set of possibly three files defined in the JSON file. While the file names really don't matter
        (they just have to match a file in the folder of the tutorial), you maybe want to name them according to the corresponding tutorial step:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The <code>descFile</code> has an HTML description of the step instructions like those at the beginning of this page.</li>

        <li>The <code>xmlFile</code> has the actual MEI encoding that is the final goal of the tutorial step. Two snippets can help to define different sections of the file:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>An "edit snippet" can be inserted to mark the start (<code>&lt;?snippet-start?&gt;</code>) and end (<code>&lt;?snippet-end?&gt;</code>) of the section that the user is meant to edit or to enter into the editor. During user input, the preview box will be live updated automatically. For validation, the <code>xmlFile</code>'s content between snippet start and end will be cut out and replaced by the user's input.</li>
                <li>A "preview snippet" can be inserted to mark the start (<code>&lt;?preview-start?&gt;</code>) and end (<code>&lt;?preview-end?&gt;</code>) of the section that the user is meant to see in the preview box (if it is necessary to provide some additional context). The preview snippet has no influence on validation and it is expected to be placed outside of the preview snippet.</li>
            </ul>

        <li>The <code>prefillFile</code> allows you to prefill the editor at any given step of a tutorial with the file's (XML) content, as the previous content of the editor will not be preserved for the next step. The content of <code>prefillFile</code> will be inserted into the editor, replacing it's content (if any). If done on the first step of a tutorial, this allows you to start with something in the editor right away (if not, the editor will start empty). Set at a later step, it allows to switch to a new "entry point" into the MEI file being edited. Like the comment in the editor below, the prefill will also appear in the preview box automatically.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Editor input is used during validation (see "edit snippet" above), so you may want to make sure that the edit section (prefill + user input) will end up in a MEI file structure ready for validation.</p>
