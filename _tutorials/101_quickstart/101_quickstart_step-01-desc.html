    <p id="tutorialGoal">Welcome! To <i>encode</i> a single <u>note</u>, you'll need a <code>&lt;note/&gt;</code> element and the three
        attributes <code>@pname</code> (name of the pitch), <code>@oct</code> (octave) and <code>@dur</code> (duration).</p>

    <p id="tutorialTask">So try to enter the following encoding: <code>&lt;note pname="c" oct="4" dur="4"/&gt;</code>.</p>

    <h1>Attention: This is also a tutorial on how to write tutorials now. </h1>
    <p>
        If you want to prefill the editor at any given step of a tutorial, please add a property 
        <b>"prefillFile"</b> to the JSON, which points to a corresponding file. While these file names really don't matter
        (they just have to match a file in the folder of the tutorial),
        it is recommended to name them according to the corresponding tutorial step.<br/>
        If "prefillFile" is set, the corresponding file will be loaded, and it's content will be inserted into
        the editor, replacing it's previous content (if any). If done on the first step of a tutorial, this allows
        you to start with something in the editor right away (if not, the editor will start empty).<br/>
        Without "prefillFile" being set, the previous content of the editor will be preserved for the next step. With
        "prefillFile" set at a later step, it allows to change that to a default value, or a new "entry point" into the
        MEI file being edited.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may want to have a different height for the editor in each tutorial step. For this purpose,
        an optional property <b>"editorLines"</b> may be set with integers (no strings please). If not 
        specified, a default of 5 will be assumed.
