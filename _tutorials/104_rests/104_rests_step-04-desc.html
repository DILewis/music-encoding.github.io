        When music is laid out with multiple instruments / voices sharing a staff, it is sometimes 
        necessary to "push" events like notes to a later position in the measure, without saying they 
        are resting. This is usually the case when the document that's supposed to be encoded
        switches between chord-based notation and separate stems within a measure. As MEI uses the 
        <a href="/guidelines/v4/elements/layer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener, noreferrer">&lt;layer&gt;</a> element to lay out
        multiple instruments, and in these situations an instrument switches between those layers 
        mid-measure, the "gaps" in those measures need to be filled. This is what the 
        <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> element is for.

        Of course, a space isn't really a rest. However, (invisible) rests are often (ab)used for these 
        purposes in other encoding formats or scorewriters. The benefit of MEI's space is that it carries no 
        semantic meaning – it just pushes other events around. This makes it much easier to actually process
        an encoding and extract individual voices for it, as no non-existent information-carrying element is
        falsely introduced just for better coordination.

        Please push the lower blue note to the end of the measure, so that it sits on the final beat under 
        the D5, as in the image above. There are multiple ways to encode it with <code>&lt;space&gt;</code>,
        <code>@dur</code> and <code>@dots</code>. It is actually possible to encode it with just one element…
