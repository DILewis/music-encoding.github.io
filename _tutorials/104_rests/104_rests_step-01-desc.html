        Congratulations, you just encoded your first rest. The next one will be easy: Encode a sequence of rests:
        <img style="display: block; margin: .5rem auto; width: 240px;" src="../104_rests.png" alt="A sequence of rests"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        For the third rest, you need the additional <code>@dots</code> attribute, where you need to specify 
        the number of dots as an integer â€“ in this case, it's simply a <code>dots="1"</code>.
    </p>
