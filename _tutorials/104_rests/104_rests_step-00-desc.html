        According to the <a href="/guidelines/v4/elements/rest.html" target="_blank">MEI Specification</a>, 
        a rest is "a non-sounding event found in the source being transcribed". Encoding that is simple:
        Just use a <code>&lt;rest&gt;</code> element, with a <code>@dur</code> attribute.
