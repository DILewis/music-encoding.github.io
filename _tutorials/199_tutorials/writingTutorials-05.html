        Obviously, proper input validation is crucial for an effective and sustained learning success.
        Because our website is based on Jekyll, however, we have to rely on client-side validation 
        (relying on an external service for validation only is probably not reliable enough, so we decided
        against that approach). To this date, client-side validation (= Javascript) doesn't offer proper
        support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RelaxNG" target="_blank">RelaxNG</a>, the schema language 
        ultimately used to validate MEI instances in real projects. For this reason, we need to use the
        XPath-based approach mentioned earlier.
