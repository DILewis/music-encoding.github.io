    <p>
        If you want to prefill the editor at any given step of a tutorial, please add a property 
        <b>"prefill"</b> to the JSON, which points to a corresponding file. These file names really don't matter,
        they just have to match a file in the folder of the tutorial.<br/>
        If "prefill" is set, the corresponding file will be loaded, and it's content will be inserted into 
        the editor, replacing it's previous content (if any). If done on the first step of a tutorial, this allows
        you to start with something in the editor right away (if not, the editor will start empty).<br/>
        Without "prefill" being set, the previous content of the editor will be preserved for the next step. With
        "prefill" set at a later step, it allows to change that to a default value, or a new "entry point" into the 
        MEI file being edited.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may want to have a different height for the editor in each tutorial step. For this purpose,
        an optional property <b>"editorLines"</b> may be set with integers (no strings please). If not 
        specified, a default of 5 will be assumed.
